## 0. Foundations & Working Agreements

1. **Repository Setup**
   - [ ] Create a new Git repository (or fork the existing one) with `main` and `dev` branches.
   - [ ] Adopt [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
   - [ ] Enable CI with automated lint, type-check, unit test, and Electron build on pull requests.
2. **Tooling**
   - [x] **Node.js** (LTS), **npm** workspaces.
   - [x] **TypeScript** configured with strict mode.
   - [x] **ESLint + Prettier** for code style; pre-commit hooks via **husky** (partial - hooks need Git repo).
3. **Agile Cadence**
   - [ ] Work in **1-week sprints**.
   - [ ] Each sprint ends with: demo, retrospective, and backlog grooming.
4. **Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - [x] Code builds & passes CI (local checks working).
   - [ ] Unit and/or integration tests added.
   - [x] Documentation updated (README, docstrings, or storybook).
   - [ ] Feature flagged if incomplete.

## 1. High-Level Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Goal | Rough Duration |
| ----- | ---- | -------------- |
| **Phase 1** | MVP skeleton (Electron, React, SQLite) | 2–3 sprints |
| **Phase 2** | Workflow engine integration (n8n / LangGraph) | 2 sprints |
| **Phase 3** | AI-driven helpers (OpenAI / Llama) | 2 sprints |
| **Phase 4** | Polish & distribution (installers, auto-update) | 1–2 sprints |

Each phase is decomposed into iterable **sprints**. Below is a recommended sprint-by-sprint path.

## 2. Sprint-Level Plan

### Sprint 1 – Project Bootstrap ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Linting, formatting, testing pipeline configured.
- [x] Hello-world window with hot reload.
* **Deliverables**
- [x] `README.md` with dev setup instructions.
- [ ] Passing CI build artifact (installer or zipped app) - *Deferred to later sprint*.
* **Acceptance Criteria**
- [x] Clone → `npm install` → `npm run dev` opens basic window.

**Additional Completed:**
- [x] Modern UI with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui design system
- [x] React Router navigation with sidebar layout
- [x] Secure IPC communication setup (context isolation + preload script)
- [x] TypeScript strict mode configuration
- [x] Multiple page scaffolds (Dashboard, Calls, New Call, Settings)
- [x] Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, hot reload)

---

### Sprint 2 – Data Layer & Basic UI Scaffold (NEXT)

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Integrate **SQLite** via a lightweight ORM (e.g., **better-sqlite3**, **Drizzle**).
- [ ] Implement database migrations for `service_calls` and `work_logs` tables.
- [x] Create minimal React pages: Dashboard, Calls List, New Call form.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] Migration scripts checked in.
- [ ] UI shows hard-coded sample data pulled from DB.
* **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] CRUD operations via dev tools confirm DB writes.

**Already Completed from Sprint 1:**
- [x] Dashboard page with stats cards layout
- [x] Service calls list page with empty state
- [x] New call page scaffold
- [x] TypeScript interfaces for service calls and IPC

---

### Sprint 3 – Core CRUD & State Management

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Wire React components to real database CRUD through IPC.
- [ ] Implement status enum transitions (New → InProgress → Completed).
- [ ] Add global state management (e.g., **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit**).
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] User can create, update, delete calls without restarting the app.
- [ ] Unit tests for `CallService`.

---

### Sprint 4 – Daily Service Sheet (Print/PDF)

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Build printable Daily Sheet component.
- [ ] Leverage Electron's `webContents.printToPDF` or **PDFKit**.
- [ ] Implement date picker & filter for open calls.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] PDF export saved locally.
- [ ] Smoke test ensures PDF is generated.

---

### Sprint 5 – Workflow Engine Integration (Part 1)

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Embed **n8n** locally or integrate **LangGraph JS SDK**.
- [ ] Build `WorkflowService` wrapper with start/stop APIs.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] Sample "Hello Workflow" triggered on new call creation.
- [ ] Documentation on running embedded workflow engine.

---

### Sprint 6 – Workflow Engine Integration (Part 2)

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Implement **Stale Call Reminder** workflow (≥8 h no update → desktop notification).
- [ ] Add system tray notification handler.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] End-to-end demo: change clock, observe reminder.

---

### Sprint 7 – AI-Driven Tagging & Suggestions

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Create **AIAdapter** abstraction with OpenAI backend.
- [ ] Auto-tagging workflow for new calls.
- [ ] UI to accept/reject AI suggestions.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] Tags stored in DB and shown in list view.

---

### Sprint 8 – Backup & Sync

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Daily DB backup to local folder.
- [ ] Optional cloud sync (Supabase storage or S3) behind feature flag.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] Backup settings page.
- [ ] Automated test ensuring backup file created.

---

### Sprint 9 – Packaging & Auto-Update

* **Objectives**
- [ ] Configure **Electron-builder** for Windows, macOS, Linux.
- [ ] Integrate auto-update (e.g., GitHub releases or Squirrel).
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] CI pipeline produces signed installers (if certificates available).

---

### Sprint 10 – QA Hardening & Beta Release

- [ ] Collect crash/error telemetry (Sentry).
- [ ] Beta feedback form inside app.
* **Deliverables**
- [ ] Public beta release artifact.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Services & utils (Jest + ts-jest).
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** IPC & DB interactions.
- [ ] **End-to-End:** User flows in packaged app (Playwright).

### Documentation

- [ ] Keep `/docs` folder with ADRs, database schema, workflow diagrams.
- [ ] Storybook (optional) for UI component docs.

### Security & Compliance

- [ ] Store secrets in `.env` (never commit).
- [ ] Use Electron context-isolation and preload scripts.

---

## 4. Backlog & Future Enhancements

- [ ] Role-based access control.
- [ ] Mobile companion app for technicians.
- [ ] Cloud multi-tenant mode.

Prioritize via feedback and analytics after MVP.

## 5. How to Use This Document

1. **Copy** the relevant sprint section into the sprint planning board.
2. **Break down** each objective into granular tasks (1–4 hours each).
3. **Track progress** via GitHub Projects or Jira.
4. **Demo** completed stories in the sprint review meeting.

---

## 6. Current Status (Updated: July 2025)

### ✅ **Sprint 1 COMPLETED** - Project Bootstrap
The foundation is successfully established:
- **Tech Stack:** Electron 27 + React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI:** Modern interface with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Architecture:** Secure main/renderer process separation with IPC
- **Development:** Hot reload, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Navigation:** Full app structure with routed pages

### 🎯 **Ready for Sprint 2** - Data Layer Integration
Next priorities:
1. SQLite database integration with better-sqlite3 or Drizzle ORM
2. Database migrations for service_calls and work_logs tables
3. Connect UI to real data through IPC channels
4. Basic CRUD operations for service calls

**To run the current application:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd service-call-manager
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Electron application will open with a fully functional UI ready for data integration.

Happy coding! 🎉
