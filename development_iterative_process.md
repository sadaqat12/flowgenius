## 1. High-Level Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Goal | Rough Duration |
| ----- | ---- | -------------- |
| **Phase 1** | MVP skeleton (Electron, React, SQLite) | 2â€“3 sprints |
| **Phase 2** | Workflow engine integration (n8n / LangGraph) | 2 sprints |
| **Phase 3** | AI-driven helpers (OpenAI / Llama) | 2 sprints |
| **Phase 4** | Polish & distribution (installers, auto-update) | 1â€“2 sprints |

Each phase is decomposed into iterable **sprints**. Below is a recommended sprint-by-sprint path.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Services & utils (Jest + ts-jest).
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** IPC & DB interactions.
- [ ] **End-to-End:** User flows in packaged app (Playwright).

### Documentation

- [ ] Keep `/docs` folder with ADRs, database schema, workflow diagrams.
- [ ] Storybook (optional) for UI component docs.

### Security & Compliance

- [ ] Store secrets in `.env` (never commit).
- [ ] Use Electron context-isolation and preload scripts.

---

## 4. Backlog & Future Enhancements

- [ ] Role-based access control.
- [ ] Mobile companion app for technicians.
- [ ] Cloud multi-tenant mode.

Prioritize via feedback and analytics after MVP.

## 5. How to Use This Document

1. **Copy** the relevant sprint section into the sprint planning board.
2. **Break down** each objective into granular tasks (1â€“4 hours each).
3. **Track progress** via GitHub Projects or Jira.
4. **Demo** completed stories in the sprint review meeting.
